this assigment for Roun drobin and Shortest job first

##SJF
SJF (Shortest Job First) is a scheduling algorithm used by operating systems to manage the order in which processes are executed on a CPU. It is based on the principle of scheduling the process with the shortest estimated time to complete first, so as to minimize the average waiting time for all processes in the system.

##Round Roubin

Round Robin scheduling is a popular CPU scheduling algorithm used by operating systems to manage the allocation of CPU time among processes. In Round Robin scheduling, each process is allocated a fixed time slice (also known as a time quantum) in a cyclic manner, and the CPU is switched between processes when their time slice expires.
